Thanks for coming! we will be documenting our journey here—you'll learn a lot of cool stuff along the way.

What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to package applications along with their dependencies into containers. These containers can be easily moved, shared, and run on any system with Docker installed, simplifying the development process and ensuring consistency across different environments.

What os docker compose?

When you need to run multiple containers for your application like a web server, database, and cache—managing them individually can be complex. This is where Docker Compose comes in.

Docker Compose is a tool that helps you define and run applications with multiple Docker containers. Using a YAML file, you can set up all the services your app needs, and then start everything at once with a single command.
